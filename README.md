This project implements the most important Spring IoC and other Spring functionality, which in turn saves a lot of programmer effort and avoids many bugs in the code.
The project is an application for registering for a session at the cinema, buying a ticket, choosing a hall to watch a movie, and more.

Several tests were also added (with low coverage, at around 14%).

Although most of the project is already ready, work is still being done on it to improve, I feel that the project is somewhat raw, but I'm still proud of it =)
